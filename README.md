# Traffix

Traffix is an app that encourages commuters to use public transport by exposing the true cost of driving vs public transport. Commuters are further incentivised to use public transport by earning Traffix Points that can be redeemed for airtime, data bundles or retail vouchers.

### Prototype
This is a simple Flask app that uses the whereismytransport API to calculate the best public tranport routes.

### Future work
In future, the car route data would be integgrated using the Google Maps API.
